## What is it?

Robot-Trader was a team project completed during my time at Dev Bootcamp. The task was to explore best-practices for handling client relations and expectations while operating under a strict timetable. The application was created to help a mock client track purchases and catalog the manufacturing of products while allowing users to make purchases from the product inventory.
